# ShopifySummerChallenge
The barebones of an online marketplace for Shopify's summer internship.

## Compilation
```javac Cart.java Product.java TestCart.java TestProduct.java```

## Product Unit Testing
Once compiled, you can run the following to begin testing store's products:

```java TestProduct```

## Cart Unit Testing
Once compiled, you can run the following to begin testing the store's cart:

```java TestCart```

## API Functionality
Currently any product modifications / cart additions must be done pre-compilation, rather than at run-time.

A dynamic CLI-based shop would be implemented in the near future, however due to time constraints, this is the
current API put in place.

## Notes
While the codebase is currently limited, the code styling makes up for the lack of substance.

The ```Product.java``` and ```Cart.java``` files demonstrate my unique method of programming. I would like to believe my code simply speaks for itself.

Additionally, I would like to thank Shopify for taking the time to review this submission.
