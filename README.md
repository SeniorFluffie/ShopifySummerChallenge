# ShopifySummerChallenge
The barebones of an online marketplace for Shopify's summer internship.

## Compilation
```javac Cart.java Product.java TestCart.java TestProduct.java```

## Product Unit Testing
Once compiled, you can run the following to begin testing store's products:

```java TestProduct```

## Cart Unit Testing
Once compiled, you can run the following to begin testing the store's cart:

```java TestProduct```

## API Functionality
Currently any product modifications / cart additions must be done pre-compilation, rather than at run-time.

A dynamic CLI-based shop would be implemented in the near future, however due to time constraints, this is the
current API put in place.
